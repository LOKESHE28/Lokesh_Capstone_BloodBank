Project Idea & Plan :		Blood Bank Management System 

Project Idea:
The Blood Bank Management System is a frontend-only web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to manage donor records, blood group availability, and basic inventory operations like adding, updating,
and deleting donor data. All data will be handled using the browser's localStorage, with no backend integration.

Project Goals :
Build a functional donor management system.
Implement Add, Update, and Delete operations.
Use a clean, responsive UI.
Deploy a live version via GitHub Pages.

Technologies Used :
HTML – Structure
CSS – Styling and layout
JavaScript – Logic and data handling (localStorage)
